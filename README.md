<h2>Learning Angular</h2>
<p>I am basing my learning on a Udemy course. "Angular - The Complete Guide (2025 Edition)" by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller 
  https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/?couponCode=ST9MT120225A </p>

Currently I am learning about components, signals, inputs, outputs, aliasses, interfaces.
